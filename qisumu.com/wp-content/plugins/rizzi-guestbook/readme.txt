There are several guestbook options for WordPress, but many of them are extremely complicated, not user friendly, have incompatibility issues, and the list goes on and on.  **Rizzi Guestbook is different.** The purpose for this plugin was to create a guestbook that is simple to administrate and easy to use, while still maintaining the necessary functionality a guestbook needs. It is definitely the easiest to use guestbook ever created, both on the administrative and user side.  It utilizes the built in comment feature of WordPress which makes the management of your guestbook a breeze.  I hope you find this guestbook useful.

Features:

* Create user-friendly guestbooks without writing a single line of code.
* Allow anyone to sign your guestbook or limit it just to users.
* Lives in a standard WordPress page and uses comments for entries, so moderation and antispam functionality works as normal.
* Two-View layout provides one view for submitting entries and another for reading them.
* Automatic paging of entries to customizable length.
* Compatible with mobile themes.
* No custom database tables are required.
* Simplistic design makes it extremely user friendly.
* Very easy to set up and administrate.

Pro Features:

* Add a date stamp so you know when people signed your guestbook.  There are multiple date stamp formats to choose from.
* Choose how many entries are displayed on each page.
* Option to list entries from oldest to newest.
* Just show the message box for users that are already logged in.
* Change the page names.
* Add Google's new No Captcha reCaptcha.
* Remove *Powered by JamRizzi Technologies* stamp.
* Hide advertisements.
